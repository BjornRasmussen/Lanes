Project Structure:
The plugin is initiated from the LanesPlugin class, which runs when JOSM boots up.

When the plugin is launched, `LaneMappingMode.enterMode()` is called, which does the following:
* Fetches the currently active data
* Creates a list of `RoadRenderer`s (using RoadRenderer.buildRenderer() to determine which kind)
* Creates a list of `IntersectionRenderer`s, first using just nodes,
  then combining overlapping intersections to create more complex intersections.
 
The rendering handled through `LaneMappingMode.paint()`, which calls each `RoadRenderer` and `IntersectionRenderer` to handle rendering of themselves.



`MarkedRoadRenderers` have an object for each lane or divider.

The plugin is launched from the LaneMappingMode class,
which creates a LanesPlugin instance.  The LanesPlugin stores one
RoadSegmentRenderer per downloaded way with lane tags.
The RoadPiece, Lane, Divider, and RoadEdge classes are all parts
of roads, and are stored inside a RoadSegmentRenderer.
The Utils class has some nice tools and constants that several other
classes need to access.

The plugin is launched from the LanesPlugin class,
which creates a LaneMappingMode instance.  The LaneMappingMode instance stores one
RoadSegmentRenderer per downloaded way with lane tags.
The RoadPiece, Lane, Divider, and RoadEdge classes are all parts
of roads, and are stored inside a RoadSegmentRenderer.
The Utils class has some nice tools and constants that several other
classes need to access.
